# Meeting Notes - Sprint 23 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Neha Sharma (Lead), Vikram Singh, Intern

---

## Transaction validation middleware for payments

- **Neha Sharma:** This is blocking our release. Vikram Singh started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Vikram Singh:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `transactionValidator.js` and `validationRules.js`
- [ ] @Vikram Singh - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Neha Sharma - Final sign-off before merge
